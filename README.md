# Qt Material Design Desktop Widgets

### What is this project
This project implements Material style in "classic" Qt Widgets, not QML.

### How to compile
Open the project in Qt Creator and compile. Then Run the project to have a small sample.
To have an idea of how configure and work each widget edit mainwindow.cpp and remove the remarks in the constructor, then run again.
